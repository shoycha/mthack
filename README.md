Hello. We are attending MT Hack 2017 at MTSU.
Our project is to create a simple webform which will serve as sign-in for a class.

Iterative builds
1) Create webform (simple HTML and CSS) -->done
2) Link it to Database and make it save in the database ( possibly mysql and php) --> done
3) make instructor retrieval page (tbd)
4) add coordinates ( tbd) --> done


bug fix notes -> database is accepting blank, add javascript required field
make UI better
